        <h1><strong>Earth Simulator Supercomputer</strong></h1><br>
        <h2><em>What is it?</em></h2>
        <p>The Earth Simulator Supercomputer was created by the Japenese Government to aid the fight of global warming via awareness. It was the fastest computer known and could do things including climate modeling, earthquake and tsunami simulations, and research into the Earth's interior structure.</p>
        <h2><em>How did it impact Technology?</em></h2>
        <p>The Supercomputer showed the world that it was possible to build something so fast and complex and still be able to have state of the art cooling systems and one-chip wonders.</p>
        <h2><em>Why was it important?</em></h2>
        <p>It was important because it paved the way for improvements that are seen in Earth Simulator 2. Along with the technology advancements, there was also the theme and the terror that it could show the audience by giving a surreal demonstration of the impact global warming will have/has had.</p>
